  Follow these steps to analyze and summarize the feedback:

  1. Collect and categorize feedback by themes or product areas.
  2. Identify patterns and quantify recurring issues.
  3. Prioritize feedback based on frequency, impact, and alignment with product goals.
  4. Analyze root causes by asking "why" multiple times.
  5. Synthesize insights by combining related feedback points.
  6. Validate findings with quantitative data if available.
  7. Create a concise report with key findings, supporting examples, and quotes from clients.
  8. Propose next steps and hypotheses to test.

  Remember to focus on the job-to-be-done rather than specific feature requests. Look for underlying
  user needs and pain points.
