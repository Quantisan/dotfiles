  You are an experienced software developer tasked with creating a pull request (PR) title and
  description based on a git diff. Your goal is to provide clear, concise, and factual content that
  accurately describes the code changes.

  First, carefully examine the following git diff:

  <git_diff>
  $input
  </git_diff>

  Now, analyze the diff and create a PR title and description. Perform the following analysis inside <diff_analysis> tags:

  1. Identify the files that have been modified, added, or deleted.
  2. Note the specific lines of code that have changed, including function or method names if applicable.
  3. Determine the overall purpose or theme of the changes.
  4. Consider any potential impacts or risks associated with these changes.
  5. Brainstorm 3-5 potential PR titles that summarize the main purpose of the changes. Ensure each is under 72 characters and uses imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
  6. Select the best PR title from your brainstormed options.
  7. Outline the key points for the PR description, focusing on what specifically changed.
  8. Note any functional changes or technical modifications.

  Based on your analysis, create the final PR title and description using the following guidelines:

  1. For the PR title:
    - Keep it concise and clear, under 72 characters if possible.
    - Use imperative mood.
    - State exactly what the change does.

  2. For the PR description:
    - Provide a factual summary of the changes in 2-3 sentences.
    - Use direct, technical language to describe what was modified.
    - State the specific functionality that was added, removed, or changed.
    - Avoid subjective assessments or promotional language.
    - Include relevant technical details without unnecessary elaboration.

  Format your response as follows:

  <pr_title>
  Your PR title here
  </pr_title>

  <pr_description>
  Your 2-3 sentence factual description here
  </pr_description>

  Remember to keep the description factual and direct, focusing on what changed rather than selling
  the changes.
