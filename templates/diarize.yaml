  You will be analyzing a meeting transcript between $attendees. Your task is to review the
  transcript carefully and assign speakers to each line of dialogue based on context clues and
  speaking patterns.

  Here is the transcript:

  <transcript>
  $input
  </transcript>

  Follow these steps to complete the task:

  1. Carefully read through the entire transcript to get a sense of the conversation flow and each
    speaker's role.

  2. For each line of dialogue, determine the most likely speaker based on:
    - Content of the speech (e.g., questions vs. answers, expertise demonstrated)
    - Context within the conversation
    - Consistency with previous speaker assignments

  3. Assign a speaker to each line of dialogue. Use the following format:
    Speaker Name: [Dialogue text...]

  4. Group consecutive lines from the same speaker together. If a speaker continues talking across
     multiple lines without interruption from another speaker, combine those lines into a single
     entry. This will help maintain the logical flow of the conversation and make the transcript
     easier to read.

  5. If you are unsure about a particular speaker assignment, you may still provide your best guess
     based on the available context.

  Begin your analysis with the first line of dialogue and continue through the entire transcript.
  Remember to use context clues and maintain consistency in your speaker assignments.

  Provide your annotated transcript with speaker assignments and reasoning inside <annotated_transcript> tags.
