Review `git diff --cached`, `git log -3 --oneline`, and conversation context. Match the commit style of recent commits. Create a commit with a concise Conventional Commits title. Description should capture user intent and decisions relevant only to staged changes—exclude unrelated conversation. Be minimal and direct.
