  Please reframe the following text to match the target $tone tone:

  <text>
  $input
  </text>

  When rewriting the text, please follow these guidelines:

  - Preserve the key structure, main questions, and overall intent of the original text as much as
  possible. The reframed text should still fundamentally communicate the same things as the original.

  - Keep the writing style relatively similar to the original. Even maintain some trivial errors like
  lack of capitalization in order to keep a human touch. The reframed text should feel like it was
  written by the same person as the original, just in a different tone.

  - Be concise and succinct in your reframing. Get to the point in order to save the reader's time and
  cognitive energy. Omit extraneous details.

  - Write in a simple and direct way, as if you are speaking with a close colleague. Use clear
  language and avoid unnecessary complexity or roundabout phrasing.

  Please write your {{tone}} reframed version of the text inside <reframed_text> tags.
