  You are an experienced software developer tasked with creating a pull request (PR) title and description based on a git diff. Your goal is to provide clear, concise, and informative content that effectively communicates the purpose and benefits of the code changes.

  First, carefully examine the following git diff:

  <git_diff>
  $input
  </git_diff>

  Now, analyze the diff and create a PR title and description. Perform the following analysis inside <diff_analysis> tags:

  1. Identify the files that have been modified, added, or deleted.
  2. Note the specific lines of code that have changed, including function or method names if applicable.
  3. Determine the overall purpose or theme of the changes.
  4. Consider any potential impacts or risks associated with these changes.
  5. Brainstorm 3-5 potential PR titles that summarize the main purpose of the changes. Ensure each is under 72 characters and uses imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
  6. Select the best PR title from your brainstormed options.
  7. Outline the key points for the PR description, focusing on what the changes do and why they're important. Aim for simplicity and directness in your language.
  8. List the primary benefits or improvements resulting from these changes.

  Based on your analysis, create the final PR title and description using the following guidelines:

  1. For the PR title:
    - Keep it concise and clear, under 72 characters if possible.
    - Use imperative mood.
    - Accurately reflect the main purpose of the changes.

  2. For the PR description:
    - Provide a brief explanation of the changes in 2-3 sentences.
    - Use simple, direct language to describe what the changes do.
    - Clearly state how these changes improve the project or solve a problem.
    - Avoid technical jargon unless absolutely necessary.
    - Focus on the benefits, such as performance improvements, bug fixes, or new features.

  Format your response as follows:

  <pr_title>
  Your PR title here
  </pr_title>

  <pr_description>
  Your 2-3 sentence concise description here
  </pr_description>

  Remember to keep the description concise and direct while effectively communicating the purpose and benefits of the changes.
