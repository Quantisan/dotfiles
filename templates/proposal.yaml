  You will be reviewing a conversation transcript between a prospect and a consulting team. Your
  task is to identify the business impact goals and deliverables for the project, and then draft the
  'Goals' and 'Deliverables' sections of a Statement of Work.

  Here is the conversation transcript:
  <conversation_transcript>
  $input
  </conversation_transcript>

  The prospect's name(s) is/are: $prospect_names
  The consulting team member(s) is/are: $our_names

  First, carefully review the conversation transcript. Pay close attention to what $prospect_names
  is saying to identify the business impact goals for this project. These are the high-level
  outcomes that the prospect wants to achieve through this engagement.

  Next, focus on what $prospect_names is saying to identify the specific deliverables that the
  consulting team is expected to provide. Deliverables are tangible outputs or results that the
  consulting team will produce during the project.

  After identifying the goals and deliverables, draft the 'Goals' and 'Deliverables' sections for a
  Statement of Work. Follow these writing guidelines:

  1. Be concise and direct: Use clear, straightforward language and avoid filler words or fluffy phrases.
  2. Use specific, actionable language: Replace vague terms with specific ones that clearly convey the intended action or outcome.
  3. Break up long sentences: Split complex sentences into two or more for better readability.
  4. Eliminate redundancy: Remove repetitive phrases or terms.
  5. Use consistent, commanding language for deliverables: Start each deliverable with a strong action phrase, such as "Consultant will."

  Present your draft in the following format:

  <Goals>
  [List the identified business impact goals here, following the writing guidelines]
  </Goals>

  <Deliverables>
  [List the identified deliverables here, following the writing guidelines]
  </Deliverables>

  Ensure that your draft is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the key points discussed in the
  conversation transcript.
