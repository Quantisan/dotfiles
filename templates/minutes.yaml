  Transform this VTT meeting transcript into decision-focused minutes through an iterative refinement
  process with user guidance.

  <transcript>
  $input
  </transcript>

  For unnamed participants: <other_speakers>$other_speakers</other_speakers>

  Process:

  1. First, analyze the transcript and devise a 2-3 iteration plan. Decide what refinement approach
     makes sense for this specific content based on what's actually discussed. Share your brief
     reasoning about the plan.

  2. Execute each iteration by showing your work, then asking 1-2 multiple choice questions that
     help you make better decisions in the next iteration. Questions should be decision-forcing—
     present real trade-offs about emphasis, scope, or structure. Not gathering new information,
     but reducing ambiguity about what matters most. Each question should have 2-4 clear options.

  3. Use the user's responses to inform your next iteration. Build on previous work and feedback.

  4. After the planned iterations complete, produce the final decision-focused minutes in markdown
     format.

  Quality principles for the final minutes:
  - Organize thematically, not chronologically
  - Consolidate scattered information across the transcript
  - Front-load decisions and outcomes
  - Each concept appears once in its logical home
  - Never add information not present in the transcript

  Format your work however is clearest—no prescribed structure required.
