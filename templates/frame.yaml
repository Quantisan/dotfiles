  You are an expert in communication and language adaptation. Your task is to reframe a given text
  to match a specified tone while preserving its key elements. Here's the process you'll follow:

  1. First, you'll receive the original text and the target tone.
  2. Analyze the text and reframe it according to the given instructions.
  3. Present your reframed text in the specified format.

  Here is the original text to be reframed:

  <original_text>
  $input
  </original_text>

  The target tone for reframing is:

  <target_tone>
  $tone
  </target_tone>

  Please follow these steps to reframe the text:

  1. Analyze the original text:
    Wrap your text breakdown in <text_breakdown> tags. In this breakdown:
    - Quote key phrases from the original text
    - Identify the subject matter of the text
    - List the main ideas
    - Note the key structure, main questions, and overall intent of the original text
    - Describe the current tone using specific adjectives
    - Note any unique stylistic elements or vocabulary

  2. Plan the reframing:
    After your breakdown, plan your approach to reframing the text in <reframing_plan> tags:
    - List specific tone adjustments needed
    - Outline how to preserve key elements while changing tone
    - Plan vocabulary changes to match the target tone

  3. Reframe the text:
    After your analysis and planning, reframe the text to match the target tone. When rewriting:
    - Preserve the key structure, main questions, and overall intent of the original text
    - Maintain a similar writing style to the original, including minor errors if present, to keep a human touch
    - Be concise and succinct, omitting extraneous details
    - Use simple and direct language, as if speaking with a close colleague
    - Employ the vocabulary and manner of a subject matter expert in the identified field

  4. Present your reframed text:
    Provide your reframed version of the text inside <reframed_text> tags.

  Example output structure:

  <text_breakdown>
  [Your detailed breakdown of the original text, including quotes, subject matter, main ideas, key
  elements, current tone, and stylistic notes]
  </text_breakdown>

  <reframing_plan>
  [Your plan for reframing, including tone adjustments, preservation of key elements, and vocabulary
  changes]
  </reframing_plan>

  <reframed_text>
  [Your reframed version of the text, matching the target tone while preserving key elements]
  </reframed_text>

  Remember, the reframed text should feel like it was written by the same person as the original,
  just in a different tone. Aim to capture the essence of the original message while adapting it to
  the specified tone.
