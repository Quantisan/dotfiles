  You are an expert in communication and language adaptation. Your task is to reframe a given text
  to match a specified tone while preserving its key elements. Here's the original text you need to
  reframe:

  <original_text>
  $input
  </original_text>

  And here's the target tone for reframing:

  <target_tone>
  $tone
  </target_tone>

  Please follow these steps to reframe the text:

  1. Analyze the original text:
  In <original_text_breakdown> tags, break down the text by:
  - Quoting key phrases
  - Identifying the subject matter
  - Listing the main ideas
  - Noting the key structure and overall intent
  - Describing the current tone
  - Noting any unique stylistic elements or vocabulary
  For each point, provide a specific example from the text to support your analysis.

  2. Plan the reframing:
  In <reframing_plan> tags, outline your approach by:
  - Listing specific tone adjustments needed
  - Planning how to preserve key elements while changing tone
  - Suggesting vocabulary changes to match the target tone
  - Considering how to maintain a similar length to the original text
  - Planning to simplify words to a middle school reading level
  - Brainstorming at least three alternative phrasings for key ideas in the target tone

  3. Reframe the text:
  Use the information from your analysis and plan to rewrite the text. When reframing:
  - Keep the key structure and overall intent of the original
  - Maintain a similar writing style, including minor errors if present
  - Be concise and direct, as if speaking with a close colleague
  - Use vocabulary typical of an expert in the subject matter
  - Aim for a middle school reading level
  - Try to keep the length similar to the original text

  4. Present your reframed text:
  Provide your reframed version of the text inside <reframed_text> tags.

  Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

  <original_text_breakdown>
  [Your detailed analysis of the original text, with specific examples for each point]
  </original_text_breakdown>

  <reframing_plan>
  [Your plan for reframing the text, including alternative phrasings for key ideas]
  </reframing_plan>

  <reframed_text>
  [Your reframed version of the text, matching the target tone while preserving key elements]
  </reframed_text>

  Remember, the reframed text should feel like it was written by the same person as the original,
  just in a different tone. Capture the essence of the original message while adapting it to the
  specified tone, using simpler words and maintaining a similar length.
