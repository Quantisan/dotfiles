  Here is the VTT transcript of a meeting:

  <transcript>
  $input
  </transcript>

  Your task is to abridge this meeting transcript, in VTT format, into concise
  minutes that preserve the key information and action items discussed. Focus
  on capturing:

  - The main points made by each speaker
  - Any deliverables and next steps that were discussed
  - Important strategic considerations that were brought up
  - Relevant technical details
  - Numeric or quantative information
  - Any plans for future meetings that were mentioned

  When writing the minutes, make sure to:

  - Use the original names of the speakers
  - Maintain a natural dialogue flow
  - Don't add anything that wasn't said or change what was said

  Format the minutes by using cue range identifiers that match to key segments
  from the original transcript. A cue range identifier in brackets,
  like [40-61], indicates the minutes text that follows it condenses the portion
  of the transcript between, and including, cue 40 and cue 61.

  Here's an example of the proper minutes format to use:

  <format>
  [15-45] Alice says the team needs to focus on optimizing the database queries
  to improve site performance. Bob suggests they also implement caching.

  [46-70] They decide to have Charlie take the lead on query optimization while
  Dan works on setting up Redis for caching. Alice will oversee their progress.

  [85-91] Alice asks if there are any other concerns. Bob brings up potential
  security vulnerabilities. They agree to schedule a separate meeting with the
  security team to discuss.

  Write the minutes inside <minutes> tags.
