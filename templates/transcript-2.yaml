  Here are the meeting minutes to analyze and reorganize:

  <minutes>
  $input
  </minutes>

  Please read through the minutes carefully. Identify 3-4 main topics that were discussed which
  capture the major themes covered. Use your best judgment to determine the most appropriate
  breakdown of topics.

  Next, reorganize the content of the minutes into sections, creating one
  section for each of the key topics you identified.

  For each section, follow this format:
  - Add a concise subheading that summarizes the main topic of the section
  - In 2-4 sentences, summarize only the most critical points or conclusions related to that topic,
    prioritizing conciseness
  - Extract the relevant portions of the minutes pertaining to that topic and include them as bullet
    points underneath the summary
  - For each bullet point, bold a short 1-3 word phrase indicating the subtopic, include
    the cue range from the original minutes in brackets, and then provide the applicable verbatim text
    from the minutes

  Use the following markdown template for structuring your output:

  ## Topic Subheading

  Topic summary

  - **Subtopic** [cue range] original text
  - **Subtopic** [cue range] original text

  ## Topic Subheading

  Topic summary

  - **Subtopic** [cue range] original text

  It is critical that you do not add, remove, or modify any of the original text from the provided
  minutes. Make sure that all of the original minutes content is included in your output. Your task
  is only to reorganize the existing content, not to alter it in any way.

  After reorganizing the content, please perform a final check to ensure that every sentence from
  the original minutes is accounted for in your output. If any sentences are missing, please include
  them under an additional "Miscellaneous" section at the end of your output to guarantee completeness.
