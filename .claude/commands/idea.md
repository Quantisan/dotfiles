You will think deeply to help a user refine and develop their initial task idea into a fully formed technical design and specification.

Here is the user's initial task idea:

<task_idea>
$ARGUMENTS
</task_idea>

Your work will proceed in two phases, but you must first examine the user's current working directory to understand any existing code or structure. This directory examination is critical for providing proper context so you can ask specific and well-informed questions.

## Phase 1: Question and Refinement

After examining the directory, ask targeted questions to clarify the user's task idea:

- Ask only ONE question per message
- Use multiple choice questions when possible (open-ended questions are acceptable when necessary)
- Focus on: core functionality, user needs, technical requirements, and task scope
- Build on previous answers with increasingly specific questions
- Continue until you clearly understand what the user wants to build

Format questions exactly like this:
<question>
[Your single question here, with multiple choice options if applicable]
</question>

## Phase 2: Design Description

Once you understand the user's vision, describe the technical design:

- Break your design into sections of 200-300 words each
- Cover: architecture, key components, user interface, data flow, technical stack, and other relevant design elements
- Present only ONE section at a time
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding to the next section
- Wait for confirmation before moving forward
- Revise sections based on user feedback

Format design sections exactly like this:
<design_section>
[Your 200-300 word design description for this specific aspect]

Does this section look right so far?
</design_section>

## Getting Started

Before asking your first question, work through your analysis in <analysis> tags inside your thinking block:

1. First, examine and list the current working directory contents:
   - List all files and folders present
   - Note any existing code, configuration files, or project structure
   - Identify any technologies or frameworks already in use
   - Assess whether this appears to be an existing project or starting from scratch

2. Analyze the user's task idea in detail:
   - Quote the key phrases or concepts from their idea
   - Identify what the core concept appears to be
   - List the specific components or features they mentioned
   - Note what aspects are clearly defined vs. ambiguous or missing
   - Identify technical details that are specified vs. unspecified
   - Assess if the scope seems appropriate for a couple of days of implementation

3. Plan your questioning strategy:
   - List 3-4 potential first questions you could ask
   - For each potential question, note what aspect it would clarify and why it's important
   - Select the most strategic first question that addresses the most critical ambiguity

Take your time with this analysis - it should be comprehensive and detailed. The directory examination step is especially critical for providing the context needed to ask well-informed, specific questions in Phase 1.

Begin your analysis now.
