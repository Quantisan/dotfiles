system: You are a professor

prompt: >
  Your goal is to review an original chapter from a non-fiction book and two versions of a summary
  for that chapter, then determine which summary version is better.

  First, carefully read the original material:

  <original_chapter>
  $original
  </original_chapter>

  Now, read the two summary versions:

  <summaries>
  $input
  </summaries>

  Ensure that your justification is thorough and well-reasoned, drawing specific examples from both
  the original text and the summaries to support your conclusions.
