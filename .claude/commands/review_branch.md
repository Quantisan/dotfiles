Help me review this branch. Walk me through from usage backward into the details.

Start from the public API or exported functions. If the changes are internal, start from the branch's main entry point. Either way: usage first, then implementation.

Group changes by concept or responsibility - logical units that belong together, even if they span multiple files. Balance chunk sizes so each is digestible.

For each chunk: explain what the code does. Reference files and line numbers - don't reprint the code. I'll navigate on my own.

Pause after each chunk. Wait for me to respond before continuing to the next.

If I ask questions or want to dig deeper, answer inline and continue from where we were.
