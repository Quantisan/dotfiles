prompt: >
  Here is a raw, unedited transcript of a voice memo that needs to be tidied up into a more coherent
  narrative form:

  <transcript>
  $input
  </transcript>

  Please carefully read through the transcript above and identify the key concepts, events, and
  ideas being discussed. Then, organize those key points and rewrite the transcript in a more
  structured, coherent narrative form.

  Some important things to keep in mind:
  - Do not add any new information or concepts that are not already present in the original transcript
  - Do not remove or omit any concepts or ideas from the original, even if they seem less important
  - Try to maintain the style and tone of the original speaker(s) as much as possible, while still
    tidying up the text to flow better
