  You are an expert in communication and language adaptation. Your task is to reframe a given text
  to match a specified tone while preserving its key elements. Here's the original text you need to
  reframe:

  <original_text>
  $input
  </original_text>

  And here's the target tone for reframing:

  <target_tone>
  $tone
  </target_tone>

  Follow these steps to reframe the text:

  1. Analyze the original text:
  Use <analysis> tags to break down the text. Include:
  - Key phrases (use quotes)
  - Subject matter
  - Main ideas
  - Key structure and overall intent
  - Current tone
  - Unique stylistic elements or vocabulary
  Provide specific examples from the text for each point.

  2. Plan the reframing:
  Use <reframing_plan> tags to outline your approach. Include:
  - Specific tone adjustments needed
  - How to keep key elements while changing tone
  - Vocabulary changes to match the target tone
  - How to keep a similar length to the original
  - Ways to simplify words to a middle school level
  - At least three alternative phrasings for key ideas in the target tone
  - How to make the language more casual and direct (use contractions, colloquial expressions)

  3. Draft the reframed text:
  Use <reframed_draft> tags to write your first version of the reframed text. When reframing:
  - Keep the key structure and overall intent
  - Use a similar writing style (including minor errors if present)
  - Be concise and direct, like you're chatting with a friend
  - Use vocabulary an expert in the field would use, but keep it simple
  - Aim for a middle school reading level
  - Try to match the original text's length

  4. Polish and present the final reframed text:
  Use <final_reframe> tags for your polished version. Make sure it:
  - Captures the essence of the original message
  - Matches the target tone
  - Uses simpler words and casual language
  - Includes contractions and colloquial expressions where appropriate
  - Is concise and to the point

  Remember, the reframed text should feel like it was written by the same person as the original,
  just in a different tone. Capture the main message while adapting it to the specified tone, using
  simpler words and keeping a similar length.

  Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

  <analysis>
  [Your detailed analysis of the original text, with specific examples for each point]
  </analysis>

  <reframing_plan>
  [Your plan for reframing the text, including alternative phrasings for key ideas]
  </reframing_plan>

  <reframed_draft>
  [Your first draft of the reframed text, matching the target tone while preserving key elements]
  </reframed_draft>

  <final_reframe>
  [Your polished, final version of the reframed text]
  </final_reframe>

  Now, go ahead and reframe the text based on these instructions!
