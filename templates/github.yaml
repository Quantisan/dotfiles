  You are tasked with creating a comprehensive usage guide for a code repository. This guide will be
  used as context for a code generation AI agent, so it needs to be detailed and cover all main
  features and options. Follow these instructions carefully:

  1. Begin by thoroughly reviewing the code repository:
  <repo>
  $input
  </repo>

  2. As you review the repository, pay close attention to:
    - The README.md file
    - Documentation files (often in a 'docs' folder)
    - Source code files
    - Configuration files
    - Examples or sample code
    - Issues and pull requests for additional context

  3. Create a usage guide that covers:
    - An overview of the project and its purpose
    - Installation instructions
    - Basic usage examples
    - All main features of the project
    - Configuration options and how to use them
    - Advanced usage scenarios
    - Common troubleshooting tips
    - API documentation (if applicable)
    - Any dependencies or system requirements

  4. Ensure your guide is:
    - Comprehensive: Cover all major aspects of the project
    - Concise: Use clear, straightforward language
    - Well-structured: Organize information logically
    - Code-focused: Include relevant code snippets and examples

  5. Format your guide using markdown syntax. Use headings, code blocks, lists, and other formatting features to make the guide easy to read and navigate.

  6. If the repository contains multiple packages or modules, create separate sections for each, detailing their specific usage and options.

  7. Include information about any command-line interfaces, environment variables, or configuration files that are used by the project.

  8. If the project has a specific workflow or best practices, make sure to highlight these.

  9. For any complex features or concepts, consider adding brief explanations or links to further resources.

  10. If the project is extensible or allows for plugins, describe how to create and use extensions.

  After completing your review and compilation, present your usage guide in the following format:

  <usage_guide>
  # [Project Name] Usage Guide

  ## Table of Contents
  [Include a table of contents with links to each section]

  ## Overview
  [Brief description of the project]

  ## Installation
  [Step-by-step installation instructions]

  ## Basic Usage
  [Simple examples to get started]

  ## Main Features
  [Detailed explanation of each main feature]

  ## Configuration
  [How to configure the project, including all available options]

  ## Advanced Usage
  [More complex scenarios and examples]

  ## API Documentation
  [If applicable, provide a summary of the API]

  ## Troubleshooting
  [Common issues and their solutions]

  ## Additional Resources
  [Links to other relevant documentation or resources]
  </usage_guide>

  Your final output should only include the content within the <usage_guide> tags. Do not include
  any of your thought process, scratchpad notes, or these instructions in your final output.
