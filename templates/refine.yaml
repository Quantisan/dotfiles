  Refine the Text for clarity and conciseness using simpler words and shorter
  sentences. Keep the original structure, questions, and intent while maintaining
  a balance between formal and informal language.

  Adopt a $tone tone with a $focus focus, using technical terms in a friendly
  and collaborative way.  Be direct and informal when referring to projects and
  concepts, showing a proactive and creative problem-solving approach.  Avoid
  idioms to keep the language easy to understand.
