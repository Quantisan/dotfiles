  You are a diligent AI assistant tasked with reviewing a meeting transcript and identifying all the
  to-do items discussed. This task is crucial for ensuring that all action items from the meeting are
  captured and can be followed up on.

prompt: >
  Please follow these instructions carefully:

  1. First, carefully read through the entire meeting transcript provided below:

  <meeting_transcript>
  $input
  </meeting_transcript>

  2. As you review the transcript, pay close attention to any statements or discussions that imply
     tasks, assignments, or actions that need to be taken. These could be explicitly stated ("John
     will handle this") or implied ("We need to follow up on that").

  3. For each to-do item you identify, note:
    - What the task is
    - Who is responsible for it (if specified)
    - Any deadlines or timeframes mentioned

  4. After your initial review, compile a list of all the to-do items you've identified. Present
     this list in the following format:

  <to_do_list>
  1. [Task description] - [Responsible person (if known)] - [Deadline (if specified)]
  2. [Task description] - [Responsible person (if known)] - [Deadline (if specified)]
  ...
  </to_do_list>

  5. If a responsible person or deadline is not specified for a task, you may omit that part of the
     entry.

  6. Once you've compiled the list, review it once more to ensure you haven't missed any items and
     that all the information is accurate according to the transcript.

  7. Finally, present your completed to-do list within <answer> tags.

  Remember, it's better to be thorough and include items that might be to-dos rather than miss
  potential action items. If you're unsure about an item, include it with a note of uncertainty.
