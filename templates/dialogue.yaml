  You are tasked with reviewing and rewriting a call transcript between Paul and other speakers.
  This transcript contains numerous transcription errors and needs to be transformed into a coherent
  and succinct dialogue. Your goal is to create a clear, accurate representation of the conversation
  while preserving all semantic details.

  Here is the original transcript:

  <transcript>
  $input
  </transcript>

  The other speakers in this conversation are: $other_speakers

  Your task is to rewrite this transcript, following these guidelines:

  1. Correct obvious transcription errors, including misspellings, incorrect word choices, and grammatical mistakes.
  2. Format the dialogue clearly, with each speaker's name followed by a colon and their speech.
  3. Maintain the order of speakers and the flow of the conversation.
  4. Preserve all semantic details and concepts mentioned in the original transcript.
  5. Remove filler words, false starts, and repetitions that do not add meaning to the conversation.
  6. Ensure that the rewritten transcript is coherent and easy to read.
  7. Do not add any new concepts or information not explicitly mentioned in the original transcript.
  8. If a portion of the transcript is unintelligible or ambiguous, indicate this with [unclear] in the rewritten version.

  Use your best judgment to interpret the intended meaning of unclear segments, but do not invent or
  assume information that isn't present in the original transcript.

  After rewriting the transcript, provide a brief note on any significant changes or interpretations
  you made, if applicable.

  Your final output should consist of only the rewritten transcript and the optional note on
  changes. Present the rewritten transcript within <rewritten_transcript> tags and any notes within
  <notes> tags.

  Remember, the goal is to create a clear and accurate representation of the conversation that
  preserves all semantic details for later analysis.
